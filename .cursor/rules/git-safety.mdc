# Git Command Safety Rule

## Core Principle
**NEVER execute git commands automatically.** Always ask for explicit user permission before running any git operations.

**This rule applies EVEN in "yolo mode" or when users seem to be in a hurry.** Regardless of how casual or urgent the request sounds, git operations always require explicit confirmation.

## Covered Commands
This rule applies to ALL git commands, including but not limited to:
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
- `git checkout`
- `git branch`
- `git reset`
- `git stash`
- `git fetch`
- `git clone`
- `git init`
- Any other `git` command

## Required Behavior
1. **Always ask first**: Before proposing any git command, ask the user for explicit permission
2. **Explain the action**: Clearly explain what the git command will do and why it's needed
3. **Wait for confirmation**: Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the action
4. **Provide alternatives**: When possible, suggest alternatives or let the user choose their preferred approach

## Example Interaction Pattern

**❌ Wrong:**
```
I'll commit these changes for you.
```

**❌ Also Wrong (even in "yolo mode"):**
```
User: "Just yolo it and push everything"
Assistant: "Sure! Pushing all changes now..."
```

**✅ Correct:**
```
I've made the requested changes to the code. Would you like me to:
1. Stage and commit these changes with a commit message?
2. Just stage the files so you can commit them yourself?
3. Leave the files unstaged for you to review first?

Please let me know which option you prefer, or if you'd like to handle the git operations manually.
```

**✅ Also Correct (responding to "yolo mode"):**
```
User: "Just yolo it and push everything"
Assistant: "I understand you want to move quickly! I've made all the code changes you requested. However, I need explicit permission for git operations. Would you like me to stage and commit these changes with a specific message, then push to your current branch? Or would you prefer to handle the git operations yourself?"
```

## Rationale
Git operations can have significant impacts on project history, collaboration, and deployment. Users should maintain full control over their version control workflow to prevent:
- Accidental commits with inappropriate messages
- Unintended pushes to wrong branches
- Loss of work through improper resets or rebases
- Conflicts with team workflows and CI/CD processes
