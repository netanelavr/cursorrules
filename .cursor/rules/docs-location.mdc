description: >
  Require technical design docs in docs/ and feature README files next to their code.
alwaysApply: true

message: |
  Documentation location rule:
  - New technical design documents must be created in the **docs/** folder at the root of the repository.
  - Feature README files (e.g., README.md for a specific feature/module) must be placed next to the relevant feature code, not in docs/.

rationale: |
  Centralizing design docs in docs/ keeps them discoverable. Placing feature READMEs with their code helps developers find usage/setup info in context.
