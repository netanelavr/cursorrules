## MCP Tool Definitions

When adding or editing an MCP Server's tool, follow this structure to make it clear when and how the tool should be used:

### Tool Title
The title should clearly indicate what the tool accomplishes or produces. Focus on the outcome or capability - what will it do for the user?
Examples:
- "Analyze Stock Performance Metrics" (not "Stock Analysis Tool")
- "Generate Portfolio Risk Assessment" (not "Risk Calculator Tool")
- "Fetch Real-time Market Data" (not "Market Data Fetcher")

### Tool Description
The description should cover four key aspects:
1. **What is it?** - Brief explanation of the tool's purpose
2. **What does it do?** - Functionality explanation  
3. **When to use it?** - Clear use cases and scenarios
4. **What it returns/effects?** - Expected outputs or side effects

Descriptions should be comprehensive enough for an AI agent to understand when this tool is the appropriate choice over others.
Example format:
```
"This tool [what it is] that [what it does]. Use this when [when to use it, specific scenarios]. 
The tool will [what it returns/effects]. [Additional context or limitations if relevant]."
```

### Example:
```
"This tool analyzes stock fundamental metrics that calculates P/E ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, and growth rates. 
Use this when evaluating investment opportunities, comparing company valuations, or screening stocks for portfolio inclusion. 
The tool will return a comprehensive financial health score and detailed breakdown of key metrics. 
Note: Data is based on the most recent quarterly reports and may not reflect real-time market conditions."
```
